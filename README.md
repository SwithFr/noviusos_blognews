# Blog / News

Novius OS is an Open Source PHP Content Management System designed as an applications platform, hence the ‘OS’ suffix. Check out [Novius OS’ readme](http://github.com/novius-os/novius-os#readme) for more info.

The ‘Blog’ and ‘News’ applications for Novius OS allow you to write and publish blog posts and news stories.

## Requirements

* The ‘Blog’ and ‘News’ applications run on Novius OS Chiba 2.
* Novius OS [‘Comments’ application](http://github.com/novius-os/noviusos_comments) is required.

## Installation

* The ‘Blog’ and ‘News’ applications share a common foundation named ‘BlogNews’ (this repository). Unlike ‘News’, ‘Blog’ includes authors, tags and comments.
